# Objectives
We empirically explore why systematic and structural racism is interwined with urban ecological processes by investigating three cities: Birmingham, Baltimore and San Francisco.

# Background Information
In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/cjschell) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aay4497), showing how systematic racism and classism  has significant impacts on ecologial and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broaded literature. We are going to explore one metric for how structural racism and classism underpin landscape heterogeneity in cities.

**Figure** in the Schell paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining.

We are going to recreate these city maps, and plot the distributions and mean vegetation patterns across cities to explore the structural inequality and racism that Schell et al highlight in their paper.


To do this we are going to use the following spatial data:  

**1.Mapping Inequality:** (vector data)  

**2.Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** (raster data)
NDVI is used as proxy measure of vegetation health, cover and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. It is calculated using multiple bands from satellite images.

```{r libraries, include= FALSE}
# install.packages(c("tmap", "raster", "sf"))
library(tmap)      #interactive maps, raster + vector layers
library(raster)       #Main raster library
library(tidyverse)    #our old friend
library(sf)           #to work with simple features data
library(stars)
```  

We first load the data.
```{r}
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/fullshpfile.zip", tmp)
unzip(tmp)
```

Read in RedLining Data.
```{r}
holc <- st_read("fullshpfile/shapefile/holc_ad_data.shp")
```

# Birmingham

We begin our analysis by plotting the redlining grade and mean NDVI of Brimingham.

```{r}
holc_birmingham <- holc %>% filter(city == "Birmingham")
```

```{r}
ndvi_birmingham <- raster("../data/NDVI/composite_birmingham.tif")
```


```{r}
shp_birmingham <- holc %>% filter(city == "Birmingham")
shp_birmingham %>% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = holc_grade))
```

```{r}
shp_birmingham2 <- shp_birmingham %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(mean_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_birmingham, shp_birmingham, fun = mean))

shp_birmingham2
```

```{r}
shp_birmingham2 %>% 
  mutate(mean_ndvi = as.numeric(mean_ndvi)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = mean_ndvi))
```

According to the two graphs above, Birmingham is largely dominated by grade D area. It is very obvious that the only A grade area has a higher value of mean NDVI. 

# Baltimore

```{r}
holc_baltimore <- holc %>% filter(city == "Baltimore")
```
```{r}
ndvi_baltimore <- raster("../data/NDVI/composite_baltimore.tif")
```
```{r}
shp_baltimore <- holc_baltimore %>% 
   dplyr::mutate(mean_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_baltimore, holc_baltimore, fun = mean))
```

```{r}
shp_baltimore %>% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = holc_grade))
```

```{r}
shp_baltimore %>% 
  mutate(mean_ndvi = as.numeric(mean_ndvi)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = mean_ndvi))
```
According to the two graphs above, the areas with low NDVI value largely concentrate in the grade D area and grade C area. We can see a very similar color pattern in the two map. The blue color is gradually becoming lighter when shifting away from the center: this follows the redlining grade (A and B in the outer city).


# San Francisco

```{r}
holc_sf <- holc %>% filter(city == "San Francisco")
```
```{r}
ndvi_sf <- raster("../data/NDVI/composite_SF.tif")
```
```{r}
shp_sf <- holc_sf %>% 
   dplyr::mutate(mean_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_sf, holc_sf, fun = mean))
```

```{r}
shp_sf %>% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = holc_grade))
```

```{r}
shp_sf %>% 
  mutate(mean_ndvi = as.numeric(mean_ndvi)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = mean_ndvi))
```
We can see that the areas with an A redlining grade have a lighter blue in the mean NDVI graph. Places with a D grade have significantly less value of NDVI.


In the end, we compare the three cities by plotting the distribution of their mean NDVI value. We intend to investigate how how the trends differ between cities. 

# NDVI Trend

```{r}
shp <- shp_birmingham %>%
  dplyr::mutate(pixel_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_birmingham, shp_birmingham))
```
```{r}
data.frame(x = unlist(shp$pixel_ndvi)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
shp2 <- shp_baltimore %>%
  dplyr::mutate(pixel_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_baltimore, shp_baltimore))
```
```{r}
data.frame(x = unlist(shp2$pixel_ndvi)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
shp3 <- shp_sf %>%
  dplyr::mutate(pixel_ndvi = raster::extract(ndvi_sf, shp_sf))
```
```{r}
data.frame(x = unlist(shp3$pixel_ndvi)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Analysis:
Birmingham has a left skewed mean NDVI plot. Most of the NDVI values are around 0.75.
Baltimore has a relatively bell shaped NDVI histogram plot. Most of the values are around 0.50 - 0.75.
San Francisco has a right skewed mean NDVI plot, with most of the NDVI values around 0.1 - 0.25.

According to the histogram graphs, San Francisco has the lowest NDVI on average, and Birmingham has the highest.

# Conclusion
As we can see from the previous two analysis, one place is more likely to have more vegetation covered in the long run if it has a higher HOLC grade in the beginning, while places with low HOLC grade would continue to have low vegetation coverage. Thus, considering systematic inequity and racism is important in the context of global change, and developing solutions to the biodiversity crisis as a disadvantage in accessing natural resources would result in laying behind for a long time. For example, some Oceania countries have low GDP per capita and release little amount of carbon dioxide, yet they are the first countries face the crisis of rising sea level. This is the inequity and racism in global change and we need to address those problems while thinking about solutions.
