This repository is a template for your team's repository.

## assignment

All work for this assignment should be in the `assignment` directory.  You will work in the `.Rmd` notebook, and commit your rendered output files (`.md` and associated files) in the `assignment` directory as well.

## Special files

All team repositories will also include most of the special files found here:

### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` Optional, an R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration.  Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file.


### Infrastructure for Testing

- `DESCRIPTION` a metadata file for the repository, based on the R package standard. It's main purpose here is as a place to list any additional R packages/libraries needed for any of the .Rmd files to run.
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` defines the Continuous Integration testing script for running the .Rmd files to confirm reproducibility.


This is a project by Joslyn and Kelly to explore geospatial data. Climate change occurs when long-term weather patterns are altered — for example, through human activity. We aim to better understand how the Earth's climate is warming!

## Project Outline

### CO2 Trends

### Global Temperature

### Melting Ice Sheets

### Rising Sea Levels
